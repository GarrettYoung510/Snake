## Reasoning/Motivation

Built as a refresher on manipulating time in javascript

## Technologies Used
* React (ES6+, state management, components)

## Challenges

* Making the snake grow and go faster
* Making the snake go in specific directions (array with replacing the head dot in a certain direction)

## Next Steps

* Making it prettier, but the basic snake game looks like this anyways
