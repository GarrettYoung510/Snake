## Reasoning/Motivation

Built as a refresher on manipulating time in javascript

## Technologies Used
* React (ES6+, state management, components)

## Challenges

* Making the snake grow and go faster
* A LOT of testing 
* I kept working on it and did not commit as often as I should have

## Next Steps

* Making it prettier, but the basic snake game looks like this anyways
